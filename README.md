This lab was created using Javascript. 
I made sure to follow the steps of declaring a variable, defining a function and then invoking the function. 
To run, go to terminal and run node index.js

### Reflection Questions

## How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

To create more flexible functions I defined the variables globally or outside of the scope of the funtion. I also gave the parameters descriptive names so I could track every step I was taking with the parameters.

## What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
I had to make sure every condition was met while making sure the code was clear and readable. I also tested the outcomes of the functions in the console with different conditions.

## How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

Refactoring code helps make sure the functions are more efficient and more percise. Also making sure that all variables or parameters are properly names helps with reusability.
